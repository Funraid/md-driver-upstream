# Disclaimer
**NOTE:** There is no development happening in this repository. None. Zero. The files available here are direct copies of the driver source code available under /usr/src/\<kernel-version\>/drivers/md on a live Unraid server.

This repository is programmatically updated as new versions of the Unraid server are released and is created solely to serve as an upstream repository for the [Funraid project](https://github.com/Funraid).
